# Length of Service Feature Implementation

## Overview
The Length of Service feature has been updated to automatically calculate a student's service length based on the number of completed council terms they have participated in, rather than manual selection.

## How It Works

### Calculation Logic
The system now automatically determines length of service based on completed councils:

- **0.00** - Did not finish their term (0 completed councils)
- **1.00** - Finished one term (1 completed council)
- **2.00** - Finished two terms (2 completed councils)  
- **3.00** - Finished 3 or more terms (3+ completed councils)

### What Counts as "Completed"
A council term is considered completed when:
1. The council status is `'completed'`
2. The student's `council_officers.completed_at` timestamp is not null

### Implementation Details

#### New Student Model Methods
```php
// Calculate length of service score
$student->calculateLengthOfService(); // Returns 0.00, 1.00, 2.00, or 3.00

// Get human-readable description
$student->getLengthOfServiceDescription(); // Returns descriptive text

// Get count of completed councils
$student->getCompletedCouncilsCount(); // Returns integer count
```

#### Updated Evaluation Form
- The adviser evaluation form now automatically calculates and displays the length of service
- Shows an informational message about the calculation
- Highlights the calculated value with green styling
- Form inputs are readonly to prevent manual override

#### Automatic Processing
- When an adviser submits an evaluation, the system automatically:
  1. Calculates the student's length of service
  2. Overrides any form input with the calculated value
  3. Stores the correct value in the evaluation

## Files Modified

### Core Logic
- `app/Models/Student.php` - Added calculation methods
- `app/Http/Controllers/Adviser/EvaluationController.php` - Auto-calculation in store method

### User Interface
- `resources/views/evaluation/adviser.blade.php` - Updated form display

### Testing
- `tests/Feature/LengthOfServiceTest.php` - Comprehensive test coverage

### Demo Data
- `database/seeders/LengthOfServiceDemoSeeder.php` - Creates demo students with different service lengths

## Testing

Run the test suite to verify functionality:
```bash
php artisan test tests/Feature/LengthOfServiceTest.php
```

Create demo data to see the feature in action:
```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=LengthOfServiceDemoSeeder
```

## Benefits

1. **Accuracy** - Eliminates human error in length of service assessment
2. **Consistency** - Ensures uniform calculation across all evaluations
3. **Transparency** - Students and advisers can see exactly how the value is calculated
4. **Automation** - Reduces manual work for advisers during evaluations
5. **Historical Tracking** - Properly accounts for students' complete service history

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New Student
- Alice is in her first council term
- Current council is still active (not completed)
- Length of Service: **0.00** (Did not finish their term)

### Scenario 2: Second-Year Student
- Bob completed one council term last year
- Currently serving in a new council
- Length of Service: **1.00** (Finished one term)

### Scenario 3: Experienced Student
- Carol completed two council terms
- Currently serving in her third term
- Length of Service: **2.00** (Finished two terms)

### Scenario 4: Veteran Student
- David completed four council terms over multiple years
- Currently serving in his fifth term
- Length of Service: **3.00** (Finished 3 or more terms)

## Migration Notes

- Existing evaluations are not affected
- New evaluations will automatically use the calculated values
- No database schema changes required
- Backward compatible with existing data

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- Admin interface to view length of service statistics
- Reports showing student service progression over time
- Integration with leadership certificate requirements
- Bulk recalculation tools for historical data
